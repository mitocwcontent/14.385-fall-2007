Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

This course presents micro-econometric models, including large sample theory for estimation and hypothesis testing, generalized method of moments (GMM), estimation of censored and truncated specifications, quantile regression, structural estimation, nonparametric and semiparametric estimation, treatment effects, panel data, bootstrapping, simulation methods, and Bayesian methods. The methods are illustrated with economic applications.

The first half of the course (Part A) is taught by Prof. Chernozhukov, while the second half (Part B) is taught by Prof. Newey.

Prerequisites
-------------

The prerequisites include 14.382 Econometrics or permission of the instructor.
